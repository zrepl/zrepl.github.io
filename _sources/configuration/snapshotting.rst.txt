.. _job-snapshotting-spec:

Taking Snaphots
===============

The ``push``, ``source`` and ``snap`` jobs can automatically take periodic snapshots of the filesystems matched by the ``filesystems`` filter field.
The snapshot names are composed of a user-defined prefix followed by a UTC date formatted like ``20060102_150405_000``.
We use UTC because it will avoid name conflicts when switching time zones or between summer and winter time.

When a job is started, the snapshotter attempts to get the snapshotting rhythms of the matched ``filesystems`` in sync because snapshotting all filesystems at the same time results in a more consistent backup.
To find that sync point, the most recent snapshot, made by the snapshotter, in any of the matched ``filesystems`` is used.
A filesystem that does not have snapshots by the snapshotter has lower priority than filesystem that do, and thus might not be snapshotted (and replicated) until it is snapshotted at the next sync point.

For ``push`` jobs, replication is automatically triggered after all filesystems have been snapshotted.

Note that the ``zrepl signal wakeup JOB`` subcommand does not trigger snapshotting.

    jobs:
    - type: push
      filesystems: {
        "<": true,
        "tmp": false
      }
      snapshotting:
        type: periodic
        prefix: zrepl_
        interval: 10m
        hooks: ...
      ...

There is also a ``manual`` snapshotting type, which covers the following use cases:

* Existing infrastructure for automatic snapshots: you only want to use this zrepl job for replication.
* Handling snapshotting through a separate ``snap`` job.

Note that you will have to trigger replication manually using the ``zrepl signal wakeup JOB`` subcommand in that case.

.. _job-snapshotting-hooks:

Pre- and Post-Snapshot Hooks
----------------------------

Jobs with `periodic snapshots <job-snapshotting-spec_>`_ can run hooks before and/or after taking the snapshot specified in ``snapshotting.hooks``:
Hooks are called per filesystem before and after the snapshot is taken (pre- and post-edge).
Pre-edge invocations are in configuration order, post-edge invocations in reverse order, i.e. like a stack.
If a pre-snapshot invocation fails, ``err_is_fatal=true`` cuts off subsequent hooks, does not take a snapshot, and only invokes post-edges corresponding to previous successful pre-edges.
``err_is_fatal=false`` logs the failed pre-edge invocation but does not affect subsequent hooks nor snapshotting itself.
Post-edges are only invoked for hooks whose pre-edges ran without error.
Note that hook failures for one filesystem never affect other filesystems.

The optional ``timeout`` parameter specifies a period after which zrepl will kill the hook process and report an error.
The default is 30 seconds and may be specified in any units understood by `time.ParseDuration <https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration>`_.

The optional ``filesystems`` filter which limits the filesystems the hook runs for. This uses the same |filter-spec| as jobs.

Most hook types take additional parameters, please refer to the respective subsections below.

.. _job-hook-type-command:

``command`` Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::


    jobs:
    - type: push
      filesystems: {
        "<": true,
        "tmp": false
      }
      snapshotting:
        type: periodic
        prefix: zrepl_
        interval: 10m
        hooks:
        - type: command
          path: /etc/zrepl/hooks/zrepl-notify.sh
          timeout: 30s
          err_is_fatal: false
        - type: command
          path: /etc/zrepl/hooks/special-snapshot.sh
          filesystems: {
            "tank/special": true
          }
      ...


``command`` hooks take a ``path`` to an executable script or binary to be executed before and after the snapshot.
``path`` must be absolute (e.g. ``/etc/zrepl/hooks/zrepl-notify.sh``).
No arguments may be specified; create a wrapper script if zrepl must call an executable that requires arguments.
The process standard output is logged at level INFO. Standard error is logged at level WARN.
The following environment variables are set:

* ``ZREPL_HOOKTYPE``: either "pre_snapshot" or "post_snapshot"
* ``ZREPL_FS``: the ZFS filesystem name being snapshotted
* ``ZREPL_SNAPNAME``: the zrepl-generated snapshot name (e.g. ``zrepl_20380119_031407_000``)
* ``ZREPL_DRYRUN``: set to ``"true"`` if a dry run is in progress so scripts can print, but not run, their commands

An empty template hook can be found in :sampleconf:`/hooks/template.sh`.

.. _job-hook-type-postgres-checkpoint:

``postgres-checkpoint`` Hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connects to a Postgres server and executes the ``CHECKPOINT`` statement pre-snapshot.
Checkpointing applies the WAL contents to all data files and syncs the data files to disk.
This is not required for a consistent database backup: it merely forward-pays the "cost" of WAL replay to the time of snapshotting instead of at restore.
However, the Postgres manual recommends against checkpointing during normal operation.
Further, the operation requires Postgres superuser privileges.
zrepl users must decide on their own whether this hook is useful for them (it likely isn't).

.. ATTENTION::
    Note that WALs and Postgres data directory (with all database data files) must be on the same filesystem to guarantee a correct point-in-time backup with the ZFS snapshot.

DSN syntax documented here: `<https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq>`_

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE USER zrepl_checkpoint PASSWORD yourpasswordhere;
   ALTER ROLE zrepl_checkpoint SUPERUSER;

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: postgres-checkpoint
    dsn: "host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres password=yourpasswordhere sslmode=disable"
    filesystems: {
        "p1/postgres/data11": true
    }

.. _job-hook-type-mysql-lock-tables:

``mysql-lock-tables`` Hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connects to MySQL and executes

* pre-snapshot ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to lock all tables in all databases in the MySQL server we connect to (`docs <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html#flush-tables-with-read-lock>`_)
* post-snapshot ``UNLOCK TABLES``  reverse above operation.

Above procedure is documented in the `MySQL manual <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-backup-excerpt/5.7/en/backup-methods.html>`_
as a means to produce a consistent backup of a MySQL DBMS installation (i.e., all databases).

`DSN syntax <https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name>`_: ``[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]``

.. ATTENTION::
    All MySQL databases must be on the same ZFS filesystem to guarantee a consistent point-in-time backup with the ZFS snapshot.

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE USER zrepl_lock_tables IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpasswordhere';
   GRANT RELOAD ON *.* TO zrepl_lock_tables;
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: mysql-lock-tables
    dsn: "zrepl_lock_tables:yourpasswordhere@tcp(localhost)/"
    filesystems: {
      "tank/mysql": true
