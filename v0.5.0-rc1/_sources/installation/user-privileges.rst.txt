User Privileges
---------------

It is possible to run zrepl as an unprivileged user in combination with
`ZFS delegation <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/zfs-zfs-allow.html>`_.
Also, there is the possibility to run it in a jail on FreeBSD by delegating a dataset to the jail.

.. TIP::

    Note: check out the :ref:`installation-freebsd-jail-with-iocage` for FreeBSD jail setup instructions.
